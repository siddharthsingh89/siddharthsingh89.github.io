title: Importance of Machine learning for software engineers
---
There is lot of buzz on Machine learning\Artificial Intelligence and everyone is fascinated by these terms. It has become important for people in the software industry- whether they are a developer or tester or any other roles to know about machine learning to keep up with the industry.

Basically, we should be able to answer questions like this.

> Can the computers think like humans nowadays ?

> Can a computer identify what is there in a picture?

> How the computer know what kind of shows I like and how it shows the perfect recommendations ?

> How does Siri understand what I am saying ?

> Can a computer draw a painting like humans ?

> You should be able to understand advances and limitations of machine learning or Artificial intelligence.

### Why machine learning now ###
In the current scenario, all industries whether Healthcare, transport, Manufacturing, Education, Sports are leveraging the advances in machine learning. It's not that all the Machine learning algorithms are invented recently. Most of them are decades older. Two important factors for the this rise of the machines are the advances in hardware and processing power which was not there earlier and the abundance of data. Now, we have lots of data and massive compute power to process the data. And now the Machine Learning Algorithms, which were lying in the academia, are deployed to the field, touching all aspects of our lives.

### Why should we learn it? ###
A lot of Experts have been saying that Artificial Intelligence\Machine learning based technologies are job killers and soon machines will be replacing Humans in many important industries. This seems to be true as they have already started replacing humans for certain repetitive tasks. This also has opened a vast field of research open to make our lives better.

Software engineering is a very dynamic field. If you are not keeping up with the industry, you risk being obsolete and may lose the job as well. It is definitely good to learn the AI based technologies in order to keep pace with the latest developments in the industry and prepare yourself for the future.

Machine learning is not an easy field. Its not the same as learning JavaScript or python. It is a serious field which is math-heavy and requires knowledge on different areas like Probability, Linear Algebra, Statistics etc along with programming knowledge. If you want to become an expert in Machine Learning, it will definitely take time and it's better to start as early as possible.

The jobs in Machine learning are highly paid. This is also a good motivation to learn Machine learning. The number of experts in these field are relatively less and these people are highly paid.

When you think of jobs five years from now,  What kind of jobs you expect when you take into account, all the advances in the field of AI and ML ?

Do you think companies will require a person to validate the functionality of a website ? Testing of software is also a field  prone to be taken over by a smart computer. A lot of support jobs can be taken over by Smart AI systems, chat-bots etc. Better to get ready for the future in advance. Rest assured that time spent in learning ML will not go waste. Also, there is lot of scope for new  theories and patents in this field as well.
