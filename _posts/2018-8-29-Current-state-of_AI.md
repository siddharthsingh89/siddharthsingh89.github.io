title: Examining the Current State of Artifical Intelligence`
---

#### Artificial Intelligence 
When we hear the term Artificial intelligence, some of us think of a Terminators, skynent, ultron etc. That's how it is potrayed in Hollywood. This term has received some much media hype and everyone is fascinated towards it, one way or another(including me). There are people who are scared of AI and there are those who embrace it. Many belive that there are alredy machines build which can think like humans or even superiour than humans. Examples are gives as -"Look, the computer is always the winner in Chess game of a grandmanster versus Computer. If they can play difficult games, nothing is impossible".

However, the reality is that we are far from that (read Hollywood) level of intelligence in machines and there are reasons that we don't have The Terminator living next door to us. The goal of this post is to understand and examine the current stage of Artificial Intelligence and present it in  simpler terms. We will discuss- What is possible with AI and what is not. We will also see the technology and algorithms behind the current AI. And also, How statistics and probability form the core of modern machine learning. Let have a look at some of the intelligent functions delivered by the ML systems-


##### How Netflix recommends TV shows which I like the most? 
They don't read our minds. There are a combination of algorithms at work here - analyzing the attributes of items liked\viewed by us and also looking at data of similar users, to provide the correct recommendation.   

##### How Google Assistant\Alexa understand what I am saying? 
They don't actual understand as they don't have idea of the world. They will not answer correctly if you 
 
##### Self-driving cars - Is it a dream? How do they work? 
Based on deep learning, the system captures the patterns when a human drives the car via a Camera and gets trained(generates some values) and when similar conditions occurs, it does the same thing which human did.  

##### Google AI beating the best Go player or AI bots beating the DOTA human players? 
The system analyzed millions of possible games to learn the Game. 


#### Examining the Current State of AI 
The field of AI has grown substantilly over the last few years. There is tremendous prgress achieved in many areas- Many alogorithms which were amore of a field of research are now working in production systems and helping the world in a real sense.

Coming at the intelligence part, it is natural to compare the performance of these machines with a human. And Humans beat the machines hands down everytime when it comes to thinking ability as the computers are not thinking butjust  pattern matching quickly using a battery of GPUs. For example, How the computer knows that the passed image is of a cat? 

The computer has seen a thousands of image of a cat, and has learned from it using backprop. Now, if we make little changes in the Image and it may classify it as a cup or sofa. A human will not make this error ever (unless doped heavily)? Here, the computuer has no context of what a cat or sofa it. It reads pixels values and compares the pattern which it has learned after seeing thousands of cat images and being explicity told that these are cats. If the new cat images is a bit different, it can misclassify it.

A mosquito with a extremely little brain is better than the state-of-the-Art AI system in many ways.

This is not a critique of the recent advances in Machine learning or deep learning; The impact these systems have on the world overall is tremendous. These systems are chaning lives- and increasing efficiency in almost everything.

However, Many people feel that the Deep Learning shouldn't be the only direction of research in the field of AI. Many of the current models are black box- adding lots of layers, learning all moves which are possible, thats just massive compute at action.

There should be more research on other directions as well such as creating machines which mimic the mind of a child and making it learn. Decoding the brain functions and create a similar machine.

#### Is it Possible to create a machine which thinks ? 
Creating a machine which thinks like us is a very difficult problem, one that has challenged researchers. One interesting and promising  direction for this is to understand the functioning of the Human brain- how the neuron are fired, how information is transmitted to other neurons, the interconnection with other units etc. How the Human brain is processing a lot of data- 3d motion video , the other senses etc. at the same time with such efficiency. This will also innvole the understanding of human learning processs, the psychology behind leanning and cognition.And all this information can be used to  create similar artificial units. We can at least mimic the brain of a mosquito- which has far less neurons than the human brain.

Or we can take a altogether different approach to learning, different from the human brain.For example,  A breakthrough in the field of Supervised learning- reward when the machine is correct/penalize when wrong and let it understand the relations among things itself. Leveraging the different alogorithms available today to create a model of the world inside the computers(now that we have  huge memory and compute power) ? Transfer of learning is given its due attention and  All machines start with the basic understanding model and they don't learn everything afresh.


#### Conclusion 

The problem of thinking machines is a interesting problem to solve- There are no machines  available in the world right now which can behave the way a chile of 5 year does. However, with the advances in the field of AI, this problem is regaining attention. There is tons of material available on the web over all the research which has been done so far on this subject. This is something which motivates me a lot and over a series of posts, I will be collecting and analysing all the research. After all, What could be better than creating your personal Terminator?
