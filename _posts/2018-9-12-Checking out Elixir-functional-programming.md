#### Should I learn Elixir ? Why not!
Elixir, the buzz among the Functional Programming Languages ? Is it safe to bet on Elixir and it frameworks ? I heard a many good things about Elixir from one of my friends who are using the Phoenix framwork in Production and thouught to check it out.
The objective of this post is have a look at Elixir and its various interesting features- to determine if it is good candidate to learn for modern web applications. Elixir is a new programming language. Although it appeared first in 2011, It has started getting some traction recently.

There is a lot of buzz on Elixir as it executes on the Erlang Virtual machine which is a time tested infrastructure in the Telecom industry. There are many interesting things, Elixir has to offer which are explained below-

#### A Functional programming Language-
Elixir is a pure functional language. For a basic idea on functional programming, Click me. If you haven't tried your hands on functional programming, Elixir is a good start. Chances are that you will find the functional programming world very different. Elixir can be a great tool to look and solve the problems in a different way.

#### Elixir uses 'The Erlang VM(Beam) or the Beast-
Elixir compiles to bytecode which gets executed on Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM- where BEAM stands for Bogdan/Björn's Erlang Abstract Machine). Erlang VM has already proved itself  in the Telecom Industry and has been used to create massive scalable concurrent and fault-tolerant systems. For details on capability of Erlang Virtual machine, read it here.

#### Great tool chain and frameworks
Elixir has a great tool chain and it is evolving fast. Phoenix framework is already in production, powering many apps. It can be used to create soft real time apps with millions of concurrent connections on a single server.

#### Clean syntax
Elixir has a nice and clean syntax among the many functional programming languages. It is a general purpose programming language and can be used to build anything. However, it is mostly suited and being used for highly scalable and massively concurrent applications.

#### Many new features-
The language has many new features which are very different from other programming languages.
eg. Supervisors etc.

#### Strong and Evolving community-
A strong community. you can expect to get quick answers on stackoverflow and the slack channel.

#### Good documentation
Elixir has a great documentation with lot of examples. There are few books and online tutorials and courses coming up as well. 

#### Lot of scope to help develop the community and the Language.
The language is relatively new and so we don't have all  the libraries and packages like the Node.js framework. There is lot of ground to be covered here and a lot can be contributed here to help evolve Elixir as a language.

### Some other things to be aware of.....
While there are lot many good things to be learned about Elixir and it certainly has a very bright future, You should also be aware of below point . Since you may be going to invest a significant amount of time and resources in learning Elixir and it's frameworks, below points can be taken in consideration-

#### It may not be the ideal First language for a beginner
While it many not be as good as python for your first language, it is a definitely a great language for Experienced programmers.

#### Not many Job offerings.
Since the Language is itself very new, it is expected that there will not be so any job openings for Elixir developers yet. However, this will not be the case always and who knows! it might be a hot skill in coming years. Who knows if Phoenix framework and Elixir may empower the next generation of super fast and reliable web applications.

#### It is not backed by a major company Yet.

As of now, Elixir is not backed up by a major company in a way the Google has backed Kotlin for Android officially or Apple may do for Swift. Already many startups are using Elixir and as the language and it's usage grow, we may expect many giant Techs. to use Elixir as well.
