title: The quest for Thinking Machines

### Thinking Mahines : 404 as of now
With abosolute confidence, we can say that as of now(2018), we don't have a Machine which can think like humans. Period. What we do have, is many special purpose systems which outperform humans in that specific area but we don't have a machine which can simply mimic a 2 year old kid in terms of learning. All that media hype for Facebook messenger bots developing their own language is a overly dramatic and would not coome under the category of thinking machines. This is an interesting field of research. 

I will gather the important research work in direction of thinking machines and add them to a repository.
