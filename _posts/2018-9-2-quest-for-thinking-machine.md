title: The quest for machines which think
---

### Thinking Mahines 

As of now, we don't have a machine which can think. There are many special purpose systems which outperform humans in that specific area but 
we don't have a machine which can simple mimic a 2 year old kid in terms of learning. However, a lot of work has been done in this area.
I will gather the important research work in direction of thinking machines and add them to a repository.

#### What is a Turing test?

It always better to start with a classic paper. The Turing test has been a fundamental test for any machine which claims to mimic humans.
