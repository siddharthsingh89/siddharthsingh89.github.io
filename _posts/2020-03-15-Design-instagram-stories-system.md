#### What's a Instagram Story?
A story is the new cool feature these days in all the social media apps- Started by Snapchat and called **Snaps**, these messages are short lived and disappear after a day. Users take pictures and videos that they don't want to keep on their profile forever but want to share the moments with friends and followers. So they share all these images and videos as stories which disappear after a day.
Facebook family of social apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram,  Facebook App and Messenger all implemented stories on their platform.
Now, Twitter and linkedIn have them as well.

#### Functional Requirements
1. User should be able to create a short lived **Story**
2. Userâ€™s followers or friends should be able to see the story in their story feed.
3. The system should send notifications to the followers about the story.
4. Stories should disappear after 24 hours(configurable).
5. User should be able to see who has viewed the story and count of total views.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should be highly available and can be eventually consistent.
2. The system should have low latency.
3. The system should be highly scalable.

#### Back of the Envelope Estimates

- Total Daily active users = 1 M 
- If every 1 out of every 10 users post a story everyDay 
- Total stories posted in one day = 10^5
- Stories have text, multiple images and short videos
- Avg Memory required for Text story = 200 Bytes
- Avg Memory required for Image story = 100 KB * 5 images = 500 KB
- Avg Memory required for Video story = I MB * 2 = 2 MB

50% text + 40% image + 10% video = 

- Text - 5 x 10^4 x200 bytes = 10^ 7 bytes
- Images-> 4 x 10^4 x 500 x 10^3 bytes= 2 x 10^10 bytes
- Videos -> 10^4 x 2 X 10^6 bytes = 2 x 10^10 bytes

- Total ~50 GB per day

- This data will not be accumulated and will be deleted per day.

#### Most Important Components of the System

##### Client Application or Web Application
- A Android\iOS\Web Application which is used to create and show stories.
- It communicates with API Servers over HTTPS using REST APIs.

##### API Server
- API server provide REST APIs to the client application to post a story. 
- Multiple servers are arranged in a farm to increse availibility and throughput.
- Requests from Client Apps are forwarded to these API servers by a Load balancer.

##### Metadata Store
- Metadata Database stores information about the Users, followers, Posts, stories. For example, to post a story, we need users followers data and add the story to their story inboxes. 
- This can be a relational database as well as nosql database. 

##### Media Store
- Media store is used to store the images , videos etc. These are distributed file systems such as HDFS or Cloud object storage systems such as S3.
- Actual images are stored in the HDFS file system and the link to these files are stored on the Metadata store.


##### StoriesInbox DB
- For every User, we will keep all the stories in this database which a user should see when he logs into the application. 
- This will be a NOSql database such as Cassandra or Dynamo to save costs and high write throughput.
- Background jobs will be inserting stories details and deleting it after they are expired.

##### Deletion Service
A backgroud deamon job which will read the records in the StoriesInbox db and delete stories which have expired and move to data warehouse system.

#### TaskQueue
- A message queue which stores the Fan-out tasks for processing.
- This is for maintain loose coupling between various systems.

##### TaskProcessor
This is needed to read from the task queue and update the database and call the notification service.

##### Notification Service
Sends notification to the Users if any important event has happened.

##### Cache Server
- Stories will be added to the cache for faster access and evicted by the background job after 24 hours.
- Redis\MemCache can be used to maintain a fast cache.

##### Load Balancer
 - A layer-7 load balancer for distributing requests between web servers to make it scalable.
 - This will also do SSL termination and Authentication.
