#### What's a Instagram Story?
A story is the new cool feature these days in all the social media apps- Started by Snapchat and called snaps, these messages are short lived and disappear after a day. Users take pictures and videos that they don't want to keep on their profile forever but want to share the moments with friends and followers. So User share all these pics and videos as stories which disappear after a day.
Facebook family of social apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram,  Facebook App and Messenger all implemented stories on their platform.

#### Functional Requirements
1. User should be able to create a story.
2. Userâ€™s followers or friends should be able to see the story in their story feed.
3. The system should send notifications to the followers about the story.
4. Stories should disappear after 24 hours(configurable).
5. User should be able to see who has viewed the story and count of total views.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should be highly available and can be eventually consistent.
2. The system should have low latency.
3. The system should be highly scalable.

#### Back of the Envelope Estimates

Total Daily active users = 1 M 
If every 1 out of every 10 users post a story everyDay 
Total stories posted in one day = 10^5
Stories have text, multiple images and short videos
Avg Memory required for Text story = 200 Bytes
Avg Memory required for Image story = 100 KB * 5 images = 500 KB
Avg Memory required for Video story = I MB * 2 = 2 MB

50% text + 40% image + 10% video = 

Text - 5 x 10^4 x200 bytes = 10^ 7 bytes
Images-> 4 x 10^4 x 500 x 10^3 bytes= 2 x 10^10 bytes
Videos -> 10^4 x 2 X 10^6 bytes = 2 x 10^10 bytes

Total ~50 GB per day

This data will not be accumulated and will be deleted per day.

#### Most Important Components of the System

##### Web\API Server
Web or API server provide REST apis to the client application to post a story. These servers are arranged in a farm and requests are forwarded to these servers by the load balancer.

##### Metadata Store
Metadata Databae stores information about the Users, followers, Posts, stories. For example, to post a story, we need users followers data and add the story to their story inboxes. 

##### Media Store
Media store is used to store the images , videos etc. These are distributed file systems such as HDFS or Cloud object storage systems such as S3.

##### StoriesInbox DB
This database stores all stories which a user should see when he logs into the application. This can be a nosql database such as Cassandra or Dynamo to save costs and high write throughput.

##### DeleteService
A backgroud deamon job which will read the records in the StoriesInbox db and delete stories which have expired and move to data warehouse system.

#### TaskQueue
A message queue which stores the Fan-out tasks for processing.

##### TaskProcessor
This is needed to read from the task queue and update the database and call the notification service.

##### Notification Service
Sends notification to the Users if any important event has happened.

##### Cache Server
Stories will be added to the cache for faster access and evicted by the background job after 24 hours.

##### Load Balancer
 A layer-7 load balancer for distributing requests between web servers to make it scalable.
