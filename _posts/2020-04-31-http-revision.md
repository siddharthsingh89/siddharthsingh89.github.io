#### Some basic HTTP stuff-
Whole internet works on HTTP and it is useful for every software engineer to know about the internals of HTTP and idea that how the web operates. I once attended an interview and was asked very detailed questions on functioning  of HTTP/2 and many questions on HTTP caching which I had difficulty recalling.
